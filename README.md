## Hello
I am Ben Daws, a 14 year old developer from the USA. I mostly code in [C/++](https://github.com/btdw#you-need-a-link-for-this-lol), [Carbon](https://github.com/carbon-language/carbon-lang), and [Lua](https://www.lua.org).

## My Projects
- I experiment with the current development stages of Carbon.
  - [carbon-packages](https://github.com/btdw/carbon-packages)
  - [carbon-experiments-repo](https://github.com/btdw/carbon)
